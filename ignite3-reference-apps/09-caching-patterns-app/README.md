# Caching Patterns - Apache Ignite 3 Reference

**Performance optimization with cache-aside, write-through, and write-behind patterns**

ðŸ“– **Related Documentation**: [Caching Patterns](../../docs/05-performance-scalability/02-caching-strategies.md)

## Overview

Master performance optimization for music streaming platforms using Ignite 3's caching pattern implementations. Learn how to coordinate multiple data access patterns while maintaining consistency and optimal performance across distributed systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Cache-Aside Pattern**: Application-controlled caching for read-heavy workloads
- **Write-Through Pattern**: Synchronous updates ensuring data consistency
- **Write-Behind Pattern**: High-throughput asynchronous updates for performance
- **Pattern Selection**: Choosing the right caching strategy for different data types
- **Consistency Management**: Maintaining data integrity across caching layers
- **Performance Optimization**: Maximizing throughput while ensuring reliability

## Prerequisites

**Required**: Complete [sample-data-setup](../01-sample-data-setup/) to understand the data model and ensure tables exist.

## Reference Applications

This module contains caching pattern demonstrations:

### 1. CacheAsidePatternDemo

**Application-controlled catalog caching**

Demonstrates cache-aside pattern for music catalog data with manual cache management, batch operations, and cache warming strategies.

**Key Features**:

- Manual cache management for artist catalog browsing
- Batch operations for efficient data loading
- Cache warming strategies for improved performance
- Async patterns for non-blocking operations

### 2. WriteThroughPatternDemo  

**Synchronous customer data updates**

Shows write-through pattern for customer profile management with transaction guarantees and consistency across systems.

**Key Features**:

- Customer profile synchronization across cache and data store
- Transaction management for data consistency
- Error handling with rollback capabilities
- Consistency guarantees for critical business data

### 3. WriteBehindPatternDemo

**High-throughput analytics event recording**

Implements write-behind pattern for analytics data with background processing and high-throughput event recording.

**Key Features**:

- Analytics data buffering for performance optimization
- Background processing with configurable flush intervals
- High-throughput event recording for user activity tracking
- Buffer management and overflow handling

### 4. CachingPatternsDemo

**Complete orchestrator demonstrating combined patterns**

Runs all caching pattern demonstrations with realistic music streaming scenarios showing how patterns work together.

**Key Features**:

- Combined pattern usage in realistic scenarios
- Progress reporting and concept explanations
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Integration of all three caching patterns

## Running the Examples

### Quick Start - Run All Patterns

```bash
cd 09-caching-patterns-app
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.apache.ignite.examples.caching.CachingPatternsDemo"
```

### Individual Pattern Demonstrations

**Cache-Aside Pattern**:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.apache.ignite.examples.caching.CacheAsidePatternDemo"
```

**Write-Through Pattern**:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.apache.ignite.examples.caching.WriteThroughPatternDemo"
```

**Write-Behind Pattern**:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.apache.ignite.examples.caching.WriteBehindPatternDemo"
```

### Custom Cluster Address

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.apache.ignite.examples.caching.CachingPatternsDemo" -Dexec.args="192.168.1.100:10800"
```

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Cache-Aside Implementation

```java
// Application manages cache explicitly
Artist artist = artistCache.get(artistId);
if (artist == null) {
    artist = loadFromDataStore(artistId);
    artistCache.put(artistId, artist);
}
return artist;
```

### Write-Through Implementation

```java
// Synchronous updates to both cache and data store
client.transactions().runInTransaction(tx -> {
    customerTable.put(tx, customerKey, customer);
    customerCache.put(customerKey, customer);
});
```

### Write-Behind Implementation

```java
// Immediate cache update, asynchronous data store update
eventBuffer.add(playEvent);
if (eventBuffer.size() >= batchSize) {
    asyncFlushToDataStore(eventBuffer);
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Cache-Aside Pattern

- **Best For**: Read-heavy workloads (catalog browsing, search results)
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency with manual invalidation
- **Performance**: High read performance, controlled by application logic

### Write-Through Pattern  

- **Best For**: Consistency-critical data (customer profiles, transactions)
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency with immediate synchronization
- **Performance**: Write latency includes both cache and data store operations

### Write-Behind Pattern

- **Best For**: High-throughput writes (analytics events, metrics)
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency with asynchronous updates
- **Performance**: High write throughput with minimal write latency

## Production Considerations

- **Pattern Selection**: Choose based on consistency requirements vs. performance needs
- **Cache Eviction**: Implement appropriate TTL and memory management strategies
- **Error Handling**: Design graceful degradation when cache operations fail
- **Monitoring**: Track cache hit ratios, write-behind buffer sizes, and flush latencies
- **Consistency**: Understand the trade-offs between consistency and performance for each pattern
