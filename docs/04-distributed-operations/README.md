## Distributed Systems Principles

**Transaction Design:**

- **Consistency** - Maintain data integrity across distributed tables
- **Isolation** - Handle concurrent access without conflicts
- **Durability** - Ensure committed changes survive failures
- **Performance** - Balance consistency with application responsiveness

**Compute Design:**

- **Data locality** - Process data where it's stored for performance
- **Fault tolerance** - Handle node failures gracefully
- **Scalability** - Distribute workload across available cluster resources
- **Resource management** - Optimize cluster utilization

## Success Indicators

**You're ready for Module 05** when you can:

- Design and implement multi-table transactions
- Handle distributed system failures gracefully
