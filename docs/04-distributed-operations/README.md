# Module 04: Distributed Operations

## What You'll Accomplish

By completing this module, you will:

- Implement ACID transactions across distributed tables with proper isolation
- Build distributed computing patterns that process data where it resides
- Apply advanced error handling and recovery strategies for production scenarios
- Design resilient operations that maintain consistency across cluster nodes

## Building on Previous Knowledge

This module builds on Data Access API patterns, extending basic CRUD operations with transaction management and distributed processing. You'll use the same music store entities while implementing complex business workflows that span multiple tables and nodes.

## Module Overview

Distributed Operations extends single-table operations into multi-table workflows and distributed processing patterns. Through transaction management and compute API usage, you'll implement business logic that maintains ACID properties across distributed data.

## Implementation Pattern

### Chapter 1: [Transaction Fundamentals](./01-transaction-fundamentals.md)

**What You'll Learn:** ACID transaction patterns for distributed data consistency

**Implementation Focus:** Transaction lifecycle management with proper resource handling and error recovery
- Transaction boundaries and performance considerations

**Key concepts:** ACID properties, isolation levels, distributed consistency

**Essential for:** Data integrity, concurrent access, business logic implementation

### Chapter 2: [Advanced Transaction Patterns](./02-advanced-transaction-patterns.md)

*Handle complex workflows and error scenarios*

**What you'll master:**

- Multi-table transaction workflows
- Compensation patterns for failed operations
- Retry strategies and circuit breaker patterns
- Transaction performance optimization

**Key concepts:** Error handling, resilience patterns, transaction optimization

**Essential for:** Production robustness, complex business workflows

### Chapter 3: [Compute API Processing](./03-compute-api-processing.md)

*Distribute processing across the cluster*

**What you'll build:**

- Distributed job execution patterns
- MapReduce-style processing workflows
- Data-local compute for performance optimization
- Fault-tolerant processing pipelines

**Key concepts:** Distributed computing, data locality, fault tolerance

**Essential for:** Large-scale data processing, compute-intensive workloads

## Real-world Application

The music store data demonstrates distributed operations through business workflow complexity: Customer purchase transactions establish ACID patterns across multiple tables, playlist management shows concurrent access handling, and music recommendation processing demonstrates distributed compute patterns.

This practical progression builds from single-table operations to complex multi-table workflows while maintaining data consistency and performance.

## Reference Application

**[`06-transactions-app/`](../../ignite3-reference-apps/06-transactions-app/)**

Working implementation of transaction management patterns with error handling strategies, multi-table workflow examples, and resilience patterns using the music store business logic.

**[`07-compute-api-app/`](../../ignite3-reference-apps/07-compute-api-app/)**

Distributed computing examples with data-local processing patterns, fault-tolerant job execution, and distributed analytics using music store data processing scenarios.

## What You've Learned → Next Steps

Distributed Operations module establishes transaction management patterns and distributed processing capabilities. This knowledge enables performance optimization in Module 05, where you'll learn to scale these distributed operations through streaming, caching, and query optimization techniques.
