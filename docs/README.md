# Apache Ignite 3 Java API Primer

Your music streaming platform just hit 10 million users. Your single PostgreSQL instance is buckling under the load. Reads are slow, writes are slower, and your recommendation engine times out trying to analyze listening patterns across millions of tracks.

Traditional solutions create new problems: read replicas introduce replication lag, horizontal sharding breaks referential integrity, and caching layers require complex invalidation logic.

## How Ignite 3 Solves Distributed Data Challenges

* **In-memory distributed storage** - Load your entire music catalog into cluster memory. Track lookups that took 50ms from disk storage now execute in microseconds from distributed memory.

* **Distributed SQL execution** - Execute queries across the entire cluster topology. Finding all jazz albums from the 1960s processes data locally on each node instead of transferring massive result sets across the network.

* **Compute colocation** - Run recommendation algorithms directly on nodes containing user data. Processing happens where data resides, eliminating network serialization overhead.

* **Distributed ACID transactions** - Purchase workflows execute atomically across multiple nodes. Payment processing and library updates maintain transactional consistency without eventual consistency compromises.

## Distributed Data Applications with Ignite 3

* **Foundation** - Implement distributed storage across multiple nodes while maintaining ACID transaction semantics for your music catalog.

* **Schema Design** - Configure data colocation strategies to keep Artists, Albums, and Tracks on the same cluster nodes for optimal join performance.

* **Data Access** - Implement both key-value operations for mobile applications and distributed SQL queries for analytics workloads.

* **Distributed Operations** - Build transactional workflows that span multiple nodes and implement compute jobs that process data where it resides.

* **Performance** - Configure high-throughput data streaming for real-time event ingestion while maintaining strict consistency guarantees.

## Prerequisites

* Java 17 or later
* Basic Java programming experience
* Docker for running Ignite 3 cluster
