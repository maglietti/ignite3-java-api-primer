# Module 02: Schema Design

## What You'll Accomplish

By completing this module, you will:

- Design distributed tables using annotation-driven schema patterns
- Implement colocation strategies that optimize join performance across nodes
- Model data relationships for distributed environments
- Apply schema evolution patterns for production deployment scenarios

## Building on Previous Knowledge

This module builds directly on Foundation concepts of connection management and basic table operations. You'll use the same music store entities (Artist, Album, Track) while learning how annotations control data distribution and performance characteristics across cluster nodes.

## Module Overview

Schema Design transforms basic table creation into production-ready distributed data models. Through annotations, you'll control data placement, optimize query patterns, and implement relationships that perform efficiently across multiple nodes while maintaining data consistency.

## Implementation Pattern

### Chapter 1: [Basic Annotations](./01-basic-annotations.md)

**What You'll Learn:** Core annotations for table creation and distribution control

**Implementation Focus:** Building production-ready table definitions with proper zone configuration using music store entities

### Chapter 2: [Relationships and Colocation](./02-relationships-and-colocation.md)

**What You'll Build:** Artist-Album-Track hierarchy with optimized data placement for join performance

**Implementation Focus:** Colocation strategies that minimize network overhead for related data queries

### Chapter 3: [Advanced Annotations](./03-advanced-annotations.md)

**What You'll Apply:** Multi-level colocation patterns and indexing strategies for complex data relationships

**Implementation Focus:** Production-grade performance optimization through annotation-driven configuration

### Chapter 4: [Schema Evolution](./04-schema-evolution.md)

**What You'll Understand:** Safe schema modification patterns for production distributed environments

**Implementation Focus:** Migration strategies that maintain data consistency across cluster nodes
## Real-world Application

The music store dataset demonstrates schema design patterns through entity progression: Artist entities establish basic patterns, Album entities show colocation strategies, and Track entities demonstrate complex relationships. Customer and Invoice entities provide business logic context.

This progression builds from simple annotation patterns to production-ready distributed schema design while maintaining consistent data context.

## Reference Application

**[`03-schema-annotations-app/`](../../ignite3-reference-apps/03-schema-annotations-app/)**

Working implementation of all schema design patterns covered in this module, demonstrating annotation-driven table creation, colocation strategies, and production deployment procedures.

## What You've Learned → Next Steps

Schema Design module establishes annotation-driven table creation, colocation strategies, and data relationship modeling. This knowledge enables efficient data access patterns in Module 03, where you'll learn Table API and SQL API operations optimized for the distributed schemas you've designed.
