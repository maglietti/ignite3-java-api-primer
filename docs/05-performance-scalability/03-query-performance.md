# Chapter 5.3: Query Performance and Index Optimization

Your music streaming platform handles 10 million users, but your marketing team can't get basic analytics because genre popularity reports timeout after 30 seconds. Customer searches for "rock albums" return results after 5-10 seconds while Spotify delivers instant responses. Your recommendation engine fails to generate suggestions during peak traffic because cross-table joins overwhelm the cluster with excessive data movement.

The problem isn't your data volume - it's how queries execute across distributed nodes. Without proper indexes, your "most popular jazz tracks" query scans 50 million records instead of using optimized access paths. Without partition pruning, artist lookup queries hit every cluster node instead of routing directly to data locations. Without proper zone configuration, analytics joins force massive datasets across network boundaries.

Your business depends on real-time insights: which genres drive revenue, which artists generate engagement, which tracks predict subscription renewals. But your current query execution creates a choice between fast responses and accurate analytics. This chapter eliminates that trade-off through systematic query optimization that delivers sub-second analytics across petabytes of distributed music data.

## Query Execution Analysis

Your recommendation algorithm queries timeout because they don't understand how Ignite 3 executes SQL across distributed data. When you run `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Track WHERE GenreId = 1`, the query might scan every node in your cluster or execute efficiently on a single partition - the difference depends on indexing strategies and data distribution decisions you made during schema design.

Distributed query performance depends on three critical factors: data locality (can the query execute without network data movement), index utilization (does filtering happen early or late in execution), and partition pruning (does the query coordinator know which nodes contain relevant data). Understanding these factors transforms 30-second analytical queries into sub-second insights that power real-time business decisions.

### Basic Performance Measurement

Track query execution characteristics to identify performance bottlenecks. Query timing analysis measures execution time with nanosecond precision and captures first-result timing for streaming operations:

```java
Statement genreCountQuery = client.sql().statementBuilder()
    .query("SELECT COUNT(*) as track_count FROM Track WHERE GenreId = ?")
    .build();

QueryMetrics metrics = analyzer.analyzeStatement(genreCountQuery, 1);
System.out.printf("Query executed in %.2f ms%n", metrics.getTotalTimeMillis());
```

For comprehensive query analysis including timing comparison and performance measurement techniques, see the **Performance Optimization Reference App** (`ignite3-reference-apps/11-performance-optimization-app`) which includes the complete `QueryTimingAnalysis` implementation with nanosecond-precision measurement and filter strategy comparison.

### Understanding Query Execution Bottlenecks

Your platform's search performance varies wildly because different query approaches create dramatically different execution costs. When users search for tracks by a specific artist, the database might execute efficiently in 10 milliseconds or struggle for 10 seconds - the difference depends on whether the query optimizer can leverage indexes or must scan entire tables.

Distributed systems amplify these performance differences because inefficient queries force data movement across network boundaries, while optimized queries execute locally on single nodes. Understanding how filtering strategies affect execution plans enables you to design queries that scale predictably as your music catalog grows from thousands to millions of tracks.

### Filter Strategy Performance Analysis

The same business logic implemented through different SQL approaches creates vastly different performance characteristics. Direct indexed filters that leverage database indexes execute 10-100x faster than function-based filters that prevent index usage:

```java
// Strategy 1: Direct indexed filter (optimal)
Statement indexedQuery = client.sql().statementBuilder()
    .query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Track t JOIN Album al ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId WHERE al.ArtistId = ?")
    .build();

// Strategy 2: Function-based filter (suboptimal - prevents index usage)  
Statement functionQuery = client.sql().statementBuilder()
    .query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Track t JOIN Album al ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId WHERE CAST(al.ArtistId AS VARCHAR) = CAST(? AS VARCHAR)")
    .build();
```

The **Performance Optimization Reference App** demonstrates filter strategy comparison with detailed timing analysis, showing how function-based filters can be 10x slower than direct indexed filters in distributed environments.

### Analytics Query Performance

Complex aggregation queries require special attention for distributed execution. Analytics queries that group and aggregate across large datasets benefit from optimized indexes and partition-aware execution:

```java
Statement analyticsQuery = client.sql().statementBuilder()
    .query("SELECT g.Name as Genre, COUNT(t.TrackId) as TrackCount, AVG(t.UnitPrice) as AvgPrice " +
           "FROM Genre g LEFT JOIN Track t ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId " +
           "GROUP BY g.GenreId, g.Name ORDER BY TrackCount DESC")
    .build();
```

Analytics queries should complete in under 1 second for good user experience. The reference app demonstrates performance measurement and optimization techniques for complex analytical workloads.

## Strategic Index Design for Music Analytics

Your music platform's search functionality embarrasses you during investor demos. Typing "Rock" into the artist search takes 8 seconds to return results, while typing the same query into Spotify returns instantly. Your genre analytics dashboard shows "Loading..." for 45 seconds before displaying basic statistics. Customer browsing sessions abandon after 3 seconds of waiting for album listings.

The root cause isn't your server capacity - it's missing indexes that transform table scans into direct data access. When a user searches for artists containing "Beatles," your query scans 2 million artist records sequentially instead of using a name-based index that finds matches in microseconds. When analytics queries aggregate tracks by genre, they process 50 million records instead of using composite indexes that pre-organize data for grouping operations.

Strategic index design transforms your platform from unresponsive to instantaneous by creating data access paths that match your application's query characteristics. Every search becomes a direct lookup, every analytics query becomes an optimized aggregation, and every user interaction delivers the real-time experience that modern applications require.

### Catalog Search Optimization

Create indexes that support common search operations. Strategic index design requires understanding your application's query characteristics:

```java
// Artist name search index for prefix matching
IndexDefinition artistNameIndex = IndexDefinition.builder("idx_artist_name")
    .tableName("Artist")
    .type(IndexType.SORTED)
    .columns("Name")
    .build();

// Composite album search index supporting filtered browsing
IndexDefinition albumSearchIndex = IndexDefinition.builder("idx_album_search")
    .tableName("Album")
    .type(IndexType.SORTED)
    .columns("ArtistId", "Title") // Supports artist-specific album queries
    .build();
```

The **Performance Optimization Reference App** includes comprehensive index creation examples with async creation patterns and effectiveness validation. The `IndexOptimizationStrategies` class demonstrates single-column, composite, and covering index approaches for different query scenarios.

### Analytics Indexes

Optimize business intelligence and reporting queries with indexes designed for aggregation and time-series analysis:

```java
// Customer purchase history index for behavioral analytics
IndexDefinition customerHistoryIndex = IndexDefinition.builder("idx_customer_history")
    .tableName("Invoice")
    .type(IndexType.SORTED)
    .columns("CustomerId", "InvoiceDate") // Customer activity over time
    .build();

// Track popularity index for recommendation engines
IndexDefinition popularityIndex = IndexDefinition.builder("idx_track_popularity")
    .tableName("InvoiceLine")
    .type(IndexType.SORTED)
    .columns("TrackId", "Quantity") // Track sales performance
    .build();
```

Analytics indexes enable efficient grouping, sorting, and time-series analysis. The reference app demonstrates complete analytics index strategies including async creation and performance validation.

### Index Effectiveness Validation

Test index performance improvements with before/after comparisons:

```java
// Test artist search performance with name-based index
Statement artistSearchQuery = client.sql().statementBuilder()
    .query("SELECT * FROM Artist WHERE Name LIKE ? ORDER BY Name LIMIT 10")
    .build();

// Test album lookup performance with ArtistId index
Statement albumLookupQuery = client.sql().statementBuilder()
    .query("SELECT * FROM Album WHERE ArtistId = ? ORDER BY Title")
    .build();
```

Good performance targets for indexed queries: under 100ms for search operations, under 50ms for direct lookups. The reference app includes comprehensive index validation with performance benchmarking.

### Index Design Guidelines

Choose index strategies based on query characteristics:

- **Single-column indexes**: Use for simple equality and range queries
- **Composite indexes**: Use for multi-column WHERE clauses and sorting
- **Order matters**: Place most selective columns first in composite indexes
- **Covering indexes**: Include additional columns to avoid table lookups

## Distributed Join Optimization

Your artist catalog displays load for 45 seconds because your multi-table joins process data in the worst possible order. Instead of filtering artists first and then joining with their albums, your query joins all artists with all albums before applying filters - forcing millions of unnecessary records across network boundaries before eliminating 99% of the data.

This happens because distributed join optimization requires understanding both SQL query planning and cluster data placement. When you query for "artists with albums released after 2020," the execution order determines whether you process 50 records or 50 million records. Poor join order creates exponential performance degradation as your catalog grows.

The solution involves designing queries that exploit data colocation and filter selectivity. By placing the most restrictive filters first and leveraging your schema's colocation strategies, multi-table analytics queries execute on single nodes instead of coordinating massive datasets across cluster boundaries.

### Real-World Join Performance Analysis

The difference between optimized and unoptimized joins becomes dramatic at music streaming scale:

The **Performance Optimization Reference App** includes the complete `OptimizedJoinStrategies` class demonstrating:

```java
// Optimized artist catalog query with efficient join ordering
String optimizedQuery = """
    SELECT 
        ar.ArtistId, ar.Name as ArtistName,
        COUNT(DISTINCT al.AlbumId) as AlbumCount,
        COUNT(t.TrackId) as TrackCount,
        AVG(t.UnitPrice) as AvgTrackPrice
    FROM Artist ar
    LEFT JOIN Album al ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
    LEFT JOIN Track t ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId  
    WHERE ar.Name LIKE ?
    GROUP BY ar.ArtistId, ar.Name
    ORDER BY ar.Name
    """;
```

Key optimization techniques demonstrated:

- **Join order optimization**: Filter most selective tables first to minimize data movement
- **Colocation-aware queries**: Leverage data placement for local execution
- **Aggregation optimization**: Use CTEs and window functions for complex analytics
- **Partition pruning**: Design queries that target specific data partitions
The reference app demonstrates comprehensive join optimization including:

- **Artist catalog queries** with efficient join ordering
- **Customer purchase history** with colocation-aware joins  
- **Genre popularity analysis** with optimized aggregation
- **Track recommendation queries** using multi-step CTEs for real-time performance

Each example shows complete implementations with result processing and performance measurement.

## Query Execution Plan Analysis

Before optimizing queries through indexes or zone configuration, understanding how Ignite 3 executes SQL operations provides insight into performance bottlenecks. The `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR` functionality reveals query execution paths, join strategies, and resource usage characteristics that identify optimization opportunities.

Query execution plans show whether operations scan entire tables or use indexes, how joins execute across distributed data, and where filtering occurs in the execution pipeline. This analysis guides decisions about index creation, query restructuring, and zone configuration adjustments.

Understanding query execution plans helps identify optimization opportunities:

```java
// Use EXPLAIN PLAN FOR to analyze query execution
String query = """
    SELECT ar.ArtistId, ar.Name, COUNT(al.AlbumId) as AlbumCount
    FROM Artist ar
    LEFT JOIN Album al ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
    WHERE LOWER(ar.Name) LIKE LOWER(?)
    GROUP BY ar.ArtistId, ar.Name
    ORDER BY ar.Name
    """;

ResultSet<SqlRow> planResults = sql.execute(null, "EXPLAIN PLAN FOR " + query, searchTerm);
```

Key execution plan indicators for optimization:
- **Index scans vs table scans**: Look for direct index access instead of full table scanning
- **Join algorithms**: Hash joins for large datasets, merge joins for sorted inputs  
- **Predicate pushdown**: Early filtering reduces intermediate result sizes
- **Partition pruning**: Queries should target specific partitions when possible

The reference app includes the complete `QueryExecutionPlanAnalysis` class demonstrating plan analysis for artist searches, customer analytics, and complex aggregation queries with CTE and window functions.
## Distribution Zone Configuration

Query performance degrades when data distribution doesn't match access patterns. Catalog queries execute slowly because data spreads across too many partitions without sufficient replicas for read scaling. Analytics operations fail to leverage parallelism because partition counts are too low for large-scale aggregations. Customer transaction queries suffer from inconsistent performance due to inappropriate replication strategies.

Zone configuration optimizes query execution by aligning data placement with operational requirements:

Zone configuration balances performance, consistency, and resource requirements:

```java
// Catalog zone: optimized for read-heavy workloads  
ZoneDefinition catalogZone = ZoneDefinition.builder("MusicCatalogZone")
    .replicas(3)           // High availability for catalog data
    .partitions(32)        // Good parallelism for searches
    .dataNodesAutoAdjust(5)    // Auto-adjust with cluster growth
    .build();

// Analytics zone: optimized for large-scale queries
ZoneDefinition analyticsZone = ZoneDefinition.builder("AnalyticsZone")
    .replicas(2)           // Performance over availability  
    .partitions(64)        // High parallelism for analytics
    .dataNodesAutoAdjust(10)   // Aggressive scaling for analytics
    .build();
```

Key zone optimization strategies:
- **Catalog zones**: High replica count (3+) for read scalability, moderate partitioning (32) for search performance
- **Customer zones**: Balanced replication (2) for consistency, conservative partitioning (16) for transactions
- **Analytics zones**: High partition count (64+) for parallel processing, aggressive scaling for large datasets
- **Event zones**: Minimal replication (1) for write throughput, maximum partitioning (128+) for parallelism
